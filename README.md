WTWR – Weather-Based Wardrobe Recommendation

WTWR is a full-stack web application that helps users organize and explore their wardrobe based on the weather. Users can create profiles, upload clothing items, categorize them as hot, warm, or cold, and like or unlike items from others’ collections. The app uses a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, providing full CRUD functionality for both users and clothing items. With simple authentication middleware and structured API responses, WTWR makes managing your wardrobe smarter and more social.
